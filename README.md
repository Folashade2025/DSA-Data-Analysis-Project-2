### Project Overview: Sales data is analysed in this SQL project to provide important business insights, such as: Finding the product categories with the best sales figuring out the overall sales for particular subcategories (e.g., Office Supplies > Appliances) Region-specific sales data filtering (Ontario, Canada).
The objective is to use SQL queries to illustrate data extraction, aggregation, and business intelligence. In order to find business insights about sales, customers, shipping, and regional performance, it offers a thorough SQL-based analysis of a fictitious retail dataset from Kultra Mega Stores (KMS). Real-world business concerns including determining the most lucrative client categories, examining return trends, assessing regional sales discrepancies, and determining shipping cost effectiveness are all addressed by the project using raw sales data. The included SQL queries are intended to show off real-world uses of subqueries, aggregation functions, GROUP BY, and JOIN, providing a solid basis for corporate information and decision-making.
